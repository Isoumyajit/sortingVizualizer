            <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
            <h3>Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m,
                r) is a key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See the following C implementation for details.

                <br>
                <p>Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation.<br>
                    <h3>T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n)</h3><br> The above recurrence can be solved either using the Recurrence Tree method or the Master method. It falls in case II of Master Method and the solution of the recurrence is θ(nLogn). Time complexity of
                    Merge Sort is θ(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves. Auxiliary Space: O(n) Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and Conquer Sorting
                    In Place: No in a typical implementation Stable: Yes

            <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
            <h3>Algorithm</h3>
            <p class="mb-lg-0">
                Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
                <br /> This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.<br> This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average
                and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items.

                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <br> First Pass: ( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ),
                <br> Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1. ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 4 5 2 8 ),
                <br> Swap since 5 > 4 ( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ),
                <br> Swap since 5 > 2 ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ),
                <br> Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5),
                <br> algorithm does not swap them.
                <br> Pass: ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ),
                <br> Swap since 4 > 2 ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
                <br> Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.
                <br> The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
                <br> Third Pass: ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

                    <p>Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. <br> We repeat the same
                        process for the remaining elements. What is Binary Heap? Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are
                        as far left as possible (Source Wikipedia) A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that the value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes.
                        The former is called max heap and the latter is called min-heap. The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array. Why array based representation for Binary Heap? Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily
                        represented as an array and the array-based representation is space-efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and the right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts
                        at 0).<br> Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order: 1. Build a max heap from the input data. 2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by
                        reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1. How to build the heap? Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes
                        are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom-up order.</p>
